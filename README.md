# Physics, Math and Grade Calculator

## Overview

This is a Java program that provides a command-line interface for users to perform various calculations, including physics and math formulas (e.g., velocity, acceleration, work) and weighted grade calculations.

## Features

- Calculate velocity, acceleration, and work using basic physics formulas.
- Calculate weighted grades based on user-provided scores and weights.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/physics-grade-calculator.git
    cd physics-grade-calculator
    ```

2. **Compile the Java program:**

    ```bash
    javac Main.java
    ```

3. **Run the Java program:**

    ```bash
    java Main
    ```

## Usage

The program provides a simple menu for users to select the desired calculation:

1. **Select a calculation type:**
    - 1: Physics Formulas
    - 2: Weighted Grade Calculation

2. **Physics Formulas:**
    - Enter the required values for the selected formula (e.g., initial and final velocity, time, force, displacement).

3. **Weighted Grade Calculation:**
    - Enter the number of grades.
    - Enter each grade and its corresponding weight.

4. **Follow the prompts to see the results.**

## Example

```plaintext
Welcome to Formula Guru
1. Physics Formulas
2. Weighted Grade Calculation
Enter your choice: 1

Select a formula:
1. Velocity
2. Acceleration
3. Work
Enter your choice: 1

Enter the change in displacement in meters: 100
Enter the change in time in seconds: 10
The velocity is 10.00 m/s
